- Game core conceit: The drawing mechanic should driving everything -- it's the fun part.
- Bonus points: make it for mobile (good for drawing with your thumb maybe?)

**NOTE:** This is a port to WebXDC with some small improvements, like sharing highscores,
the original game can be found [here](https://github.com/arikwex/runekeeper)
